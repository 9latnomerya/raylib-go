Alternatively, you can use the official language packs for Windows XP from Microsoft[^2^]. These are supported by Microsoft and do not contain any malware.

1. Select Start > Settings > Time & language > Language & region.
2. Open Language settings
3. Go to Preferred languages, select Add a language.
4. In Choose a language to install, enter and select the name of the language that you want to install, then select Next.
5. In Install language features, select the features that you want to use, then select Install.
