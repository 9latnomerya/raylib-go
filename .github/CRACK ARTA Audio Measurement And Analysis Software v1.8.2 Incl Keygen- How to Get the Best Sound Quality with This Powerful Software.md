- Added support for ASIO drivers with more than 32 channels.
- Added option to save impulse response as WAV file.
- Added option to export frequency response as text file.
- Added option to copy spectrum analyzer settings to clipboard.
- Added option to show peak hold curve in spectrum analyzer.
- Added option to show coherence function in frequency response measurement.
- Added option to show phase margin and group delay in frequency response measurement.
- Added option to show impulse response envelope (ETC) curve in impulse response analysis.
- Added option to show directivity sonogram in impulse response analysis.
- Added option to show speech intelligibility measures (MTF, STI, STIPA, %AL) in impulse response analysis.
- Improved user interface and help files.

## What Can You Do with ARTA?
 
ARTA software contains three programs: ARTA.EXE, STEPS.EXE, and LIMP.EXE. Each program has a specific function and purpose:

- **ARTA.EXE** - program for the impulse response measurement, real-time spectrum analysis and frequency response measurements. It can also be used as a virtual SPL meter with various modes and features.
- **STEPS.EXE** - program for frequency response measurements with stepped-sine excitation. It can also measure harmonic distortions and intermodulation distortions of audio devices.
- **LIMP.EXE** - program for the loudspeaker impedance measurement and loudspeaker parameters estimation. It can also measure electrical impedance of other devices such as transformers, filters, etc.

With these programs, you can perform various tasks such as:

- Analyze the acoustical properties of rooms, halls, auditoriums, etc.
- Measure the frequency response, phase response, impulse response, group delay, etc. of audio devices such as amplifiers, speakers, microphones, etc.
- Evaluate the performance and quality of audio devices such as THD, SNR, IMD, etc.
- Design and test audio filters, crossovers, equalizers, etc.
- Tune and optimize your audio system for the best sound quality and accuracy.

## How to Use ARTA?
 
To use ARTA software, you need a PC computer with Windows OS (7/8/10/11), a sound card with ASIO drivers (recommended), a microphone with a preamplifier (calibrated), and a signal generator or an external source of test signals (optional).
 
You also need to install the ARTA software on your computer by downloading it from the official website (https://artalabs.hr/download.htm) and following the instructions. You can use the software in demo mode for free or purchase a license key for full functionality ($79 for personal use or $149 for commercial use).
